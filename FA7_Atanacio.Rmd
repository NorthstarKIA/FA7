Exercise 5.1 
1. A machine produces memory sticks of varying lengths, distributed uniformly between 2 and 12 mm. Memory sticks longer than 10 mm do not meet the design criterion, and must be scrapped.


(a) Calculate the probability that a memory stick will be scrapped.
(b) Simulate 50 memory stick lengths and obtain a histogram of the simulated values. Calculate the simulated mean and variance.

(a)
```{r}
Length <- 12 - 2
MemoryStick <- 2/Length
MemoryStick
```
(b)
```{r}
Random <- runif(m=50, min=2, max=12)
Random
hist(Random)
var(Random)
mean(Random)
```
2. Students in an electrical engineering laboratory measure current in a circuit using an ammeter. Due to several random factors, the measurement, X, follows the probability density function f(x) = 0.025 x + b, 2 < x < 6. 
(a)Show that b = 0.15. 
(b)Find the probability the measurement of the current exceeds 3 amps. 
(c)Find E(X). 
(d)Find the probability that all three laboratory partners measure the current independently as less than 4 amps.
```{r}
#2. A.
below_x = 2
above_x = 6
b <- 0.15
f <- function(x) ifelse(6 > x & x > 2, 0.025*x + b, 0)
Density <- integrate(f, below_x = 2, above_x = 6)$val
y <- 0.1
Genuine_Probability <- (abs(PDensity - 1) < y) 
Genuine_Probability
# 2. B.
Exceed3 <- integrate(f, below_x = 3, above_x = 6)$val
cat("Probability that measurement exceeds 3 is =", Exceed3)
# 2. C.
F_EX <- integrate(function(x) x * f(x), below_x = 2, above_x = 6)$val
cat("Expected value of X =", round(F_EX, 2))
```
3. In a radio communications system, the phase difference X between the transmitter and receiver is modeled as having a uniform density.
```{r}
#3
LowerLimit <- c(-3.14)
UpperLimit <- c(3.14)

pdf <- function(x) {
  ifelse(abs(x) <= 3.14, 1/(2*3.14), 0)
}
prob1 <- integrate(pdf, below_x = LowerLimit, below_x = 0)$val
prob1
prob2 <- integrate(pdf, below_x = LowerLimit, above_x = 3.14/2)$val
prob2

```
